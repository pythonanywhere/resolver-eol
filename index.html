    <h1>Sadly, Resolver Systems is no more</h1>

    <p>
        As of 16 October 2012, the
        <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> product
        from Resolver Systems
        Ltd has been acquired by a new company, PythonAnywhere LLP. The team
        will remain the same, and will continue to operate from the same
        office in London &mdash; customers and users should see no change apart
        from the company name on their invoices and in the "about us" links
        on the website.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Resolver One spreadsheet is no longer
        supported.  If you're interested in Pythonic spreadsheets, you might
        like to check out the Open Source version of our experimental web-based
        Python spreadsheet,
        <a href="https://github.com/pythonanywhere/dirigible-spreadsheet">Project Dirigible</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This change has allowed us to get off to a fresh start, and we look
        forward to growing the PythonAnywhere community in the years to come.
